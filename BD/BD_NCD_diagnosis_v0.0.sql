-- The first CTEs build the frame for patients entering and exiting the cohort. This frame is based on NCD forms with visit types of 'initial visit' and 'discharge visit'. The query takes all initial visit dates and matches discharge visit dates if the discharge visit date falls between the initial visit date and the next initial visit date (if present).
